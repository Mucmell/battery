<h2> What's all this about? </h2>

<p> /Energy is a way to keep track of your own energy throughout the week. This is how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li> Sign up for an account. </li>
<li> Give your phone number, how you feel now, and what time you want to check in at. </li>
<li> At that time each day, you get a text asking if you have more, less or about the same energy as the day before. </li>
<li> Your battery adjusts accordingly. </li>
<li> Use it as a gentle reminder - or as a signal to others for when would be a good time to reach out. </li>
</ol>
